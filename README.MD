- Modules: 
    - ES6 modules, imports and exports are not supported in node yet.
- Events:
    - Node has `event` module built in that can be imported by `require('event')`. Which will you give a class that can be used to create objects
    - `.on()` and `.emit()` methods of that class can be used after creating object.
